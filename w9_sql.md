## Census

1. The university of Bristol is situated in the Cabot ward (ward names are not always distinct, but this one is). Find the names and codes of the CLU, region and country containing the Cabot ward (CLU = county level unit = "row in County table").
2. Find the number of women managers in the Cabot ward.
3. For the Stoke Bishop ward, list the 9 occupation class names and the number of men in each occupation. Your table should have two columns called name and number.

1. How many women work in sales and customer service occupations and live in the Cabot ward of Bristol?
2. How many people work in sales and customer service occupations and live in the Cabot ward of Bristol?
3. How many people work in caring, leisure and other service occupations in all of the City of Bristol CLU?
4. In the Cabot ward, produce a table listing the names of the 9 occupation classes and the number of people in each of the classes in this ward.
5. Find the working population, ward name and CLU name for the smallest ward (by working population) in the 2011 census.
6. The same as the last question, but now produce a table with two rows, one for the smallest and one for the largest ward. There's no quicker way than repeating the last query twice, the question is how to stick the two "copies" together.
7. Find the average size of a ward's working population in the London region.
8. The same as the last question but now for every regionâ€”your query should produce a table with one row per region.
9. Produce a table that lists, for each of the 9 regions of England, the percentage of people in managerial occupations who are women.
10. For all CLUs in the London region, produce a table with three columns called CLU, occupation and count such that:

- CLU is the CLU name.
- count is the number of people of the occupation class in question in the given CLU.
- occupation is the name of the occupation class.
- Only rows with count >= 10000 appear in the table.
- The table is sorted by count ascending.

1. Create a table with three columns occupation, women and men and one row per occupation class. The occupation column should list the occupation class names. The women and men columns in each row should list the total number of women resp. men in the row's occupation class in the whole dataset. The intention here is not to have to copy-paste a subquery 9 times.
2. The same as question 9, but now with a 10th row in the table listing the value for all of England. You can use the string 'England' for the region column.
